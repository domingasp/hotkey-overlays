  <strong>Hotkey Overlays</strong>
</h1>

## Introduction

`Hotkey Overlays` is a simple application which was designed with single monitor users in mind. Using this bit of software you are able to create overlays with custom hotkey configuration.

## Features

- Create an infinite amount of overlay configurations.
- Use images from your local drive or any URL.
- Allows clickthrough to applications beneath any opened overlay.

## Usage

The application automatically minimizes to the tray and the configured hotkeys can be used straight away.

- Click the name of an overlay to change it.
- Click the configured hotkey to configure a new one.
- Click the image button to replace it.

## Limitations

Unfortunately, it is not possible for overlays to open in front of exclusive fullscreen applications - make sure your applications are run using `borderless fullscreen`.
