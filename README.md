  <strong>Hotkey Overlays</strong>
</h1>

## Introduction

`Hotkey Overlays` is a simple application which was designed with single monitor users in mind. Using this bit of software you are able to create overlays with custom hotkey configuration.

## Features

- Create an infinite amount of overlay configurations.
- Use images from your local drive or any URL.
- Allows clickthrough to applications beneath any opened overlay.
- Configure the position and size of your overlays.
- Reorder your overlays to make sure the correct overlays are always displayed.

## Usage

The application automatically minimizes to the tray and the configured hotkeys can be used straight away.

- Click the name of an overlay to change it.
- Click the configured hotkey to configure a new one.
- Click the image button to replace it.
- Click the blue button next to the image to adjust position and size.
- Use the move icon to rearrange your Overlays. This affects the render order, top of the list renders on top of all the others.

## Limitations

Unfortunately, it is not possible for overlays to open in front of exclusive fullscreen applications - make sure your applications are run using `borderless fullscreen`.

When downloading the application you will recieve a security warning, the app is completely safe (check the source code) but it is not signed. If anyone has code signing certificates that would be appreciated to help ease the download and installation process.
